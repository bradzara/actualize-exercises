# DELIBERATE PRACTICE REFLECTION
# Paste a deliberate practice question you are currently working on below.
# Write the code to solve the problem without looking at any notes or other resources.

# Make a hash to store a person's first name, last name, and email address. Then print each attribute on separate lines.

person = {"First name" => "Bradley", "Last name" => "Zara", "Email" => "bradzara93@gmail.com"}
pp person["First name"]
pp person["Last name"]
pp person["Email"]


# Were you able to easily solve the problem from memory?
# If so, describe the next skill you will start to practice tomorrow.
# If not, describe the part you got stuck on that requires more practice.

# I remembered how to create a hash from memory, 
# but forgot that I need to write three seperate print statements to get each attribute on a seperate line
