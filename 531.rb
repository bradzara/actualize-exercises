# DELIBERATE PRACTICE REFLECTION
# Paste a deliberate practice question you are currently working on below.
# Write the code to solve the problem without looking at any notes or other resources.


# Were you able to easily solve the problem from memory?
# If so, describe the next skill you will start to practice tomorrow.
# If not, describe the part you got stuck on that requires more practice.


# Write a program that uses variables to store a first and last name, then prints the full name in one line using string interpolation (the #{} operator).

first_name = "Bradley"
last_name = "Zara"

pp "My name is #{first_name} #{last_name}"

# I remembered from memory
# continuing with intermediate variables
