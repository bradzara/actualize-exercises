# DELIBERATE PRACTICE REFLECTION
# Paste a deliberate practice question you are currently working on below.
# Write the code to solve the problem without looking at any notes or other resources.

# Use variables to store two numbers, then write a condition that prints 1 if the first number is less than zero 
# and the second number is greater than 0, and prints 0 otherwise.

number1 = 3
number2 = 23

if number1 < 0 && number2 > 0
  puts 1
else
  puts 0
end

# Were you able to easily solve the problem from memory?
# If so, describe the next skill you will start to practice tomorrow.
# If not, describe the part you got stuck on that requires more practice.

# I was able to do this from memory
# Tomorrow i will start practice with loops
