# DELIBERATE PRACTICE REFLECTION
# Paste a deliberate practice question you are currently working on below.
# Write the code to solve the problem without looking at any notes or other resources.


# Were you able to easily solve the problem from memory?
# If so, describe the next skill you will start to practice tomorrow.
# If not, describe the part you got stuck on that requires more practice.


# Make an array of hashes to store the first name and last name for 3 different people. Then print out the first person's info.

people = [
  { "First name" => "John", "Last name" => "Smith",},
  {"First name" => "Robert", "Last name" => "Allen"},
  {"First name" => "Alice", "Last name" => "Wright"}
]

pp people[0]["First name"]
pp people[0]["Last name"]

# I remembered how to do this from memory but the first time around i printed the results as 'pp person[0]'
# which printed out the desired outcome with the keys as well
# Next, I will continue with hashes
