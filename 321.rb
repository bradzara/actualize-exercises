# DELIBERATE PRACTICE REFLECTION
# Paste a deliberate practice question you are currently working on below.
# Write the code to solve the problem without looking at any notes or other resources.

# Create an array to store 4 letters. Then change the second letter to a number and print the array on one line.

letters = ["a", "b", "c", "d"]
letters[1] = 8
p letters

# Were you able to easily solve the problem from memory?
# If so, describe the next skill you will start to practice tomorrow.
# If not, describe the part you got stuck on that requires more practice.

# I was able to solve from memory
# Tomorrow, I will continue to work on arrays and hashes
