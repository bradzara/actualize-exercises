# DELIBERATE PRACTICE REFLECTION
# Paste a deliberate practice question you are currently working on below.
# Write the code to solve the problem without looking at any notes or other resources.


# Were you able to easily solve the problem from memory?
# If so, describe the next skill you will start to practice tomorrow.
# If not, describe the part you got stuck on that requires more practice.


# Write a program that uses variables to store three different colors, 
# then prints out a sentence using the colors with string concatenation (the + operator).

color1 = "red"
color2 = "white"
color3 = "blue"

puts "The colors of the American flag are " + color1 + ", " + color2 + ", and " + color3 + "."

# I remembered this from memory
