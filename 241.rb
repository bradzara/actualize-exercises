# DELIBERATE PRACTICE REFLECTION
# Paste a deliberate practice question you are currently working on below.
# Write the code to solve the problem without looking at any notes or other resources.

# Use a variable to store a number, then write a condition that prints 1 if the number is over 9000, and prints -1 otherwise.

number = 293847

if number > 9000
  puts 1
else
  puts -1
end

# Were you able to easily solve the problem from memory?
# If so, describe the next skill you will start to practice tomorrow.
# If not, describe the part you got stuck on that requires more practice.


# Yes, I was able to solve from memory
# Tomorrow, I will continue with "if" statments
