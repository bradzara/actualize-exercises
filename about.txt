My name is Bradley Zara. I have a bachelors degree in Information Systems with a focus in Cybersecurity.
I really enjoyed my coding courses while I was in college and recently just met a friend who is a 
software engineer who told me I would be a good candidate as a coder. I have already been working in 
the tech field as a network administrator and am excited to switch things up to this exciting field.
As a musician, I would love to work for a streaming platform such as Spotify.
