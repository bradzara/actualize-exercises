# DELIBERATE PRACTICE REFLECTION
# Paste a deliberate practice question you are currently working on below.
# Write the code to solve the problem without looking at any notes or other resources.

# Write a program that uses variables to store two words, then prints both words on the same line in all capital letters.

word1 = "deliberate"
word2 = "practice"

puts (word1 + ' ' + word2).upcase


# Were you able to easily solve the problem from memory?
# If so, describe the next skill you will start to practice tomorrow.
# If not, describe the part you got stuck on that requires more practice.

# I was able to do this from memory, although my solution was slightly different from the one provided
# I put my string equation in parenthesis so I only had to use the upcase command once. I also inserted a space.
# Tomorrow, I will be working on printing out the number of charcters in a word.
