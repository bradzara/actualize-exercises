# DELIBERATE PRACTICE REFLECTION
# Paste a deliberate practice question you are currently working on below.
# Write the code to solve the problem without looking at any notes or other resources.


# Were you able to easily solve the problem from memory?
# If so, describe the next skill you will start to practice tomorrow.
# If not, describe the part you got stuck on that requires more practice.


# Write a Person class with attributes for name and age.

class Person
  def initialize(name, age)
    @name = name
    @age = age
  end
end

person_1 = Person.new("Brad", 31)

pp person_1

# I remembered this from memory
# Today, I am going to finish the basic deliberate practice problems and move onto the intermediate ones
