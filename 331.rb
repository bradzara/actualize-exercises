# DELIBERATE PRACTICE REFLECTION
# Paste a deliberate practice question you are currently working on below.
# Write the code to solve the problem without looking at any notes or other resources.

# Create an array to store 2 numbers. Then print out each number on separate lines with a while loop.

numbers = [5, 9]
index = 0
while index < numbers.length
  p numbers[index]
  index = index + 1
end

# Were you able to easily solve the problem from memory?
# If so, describe the next skill you will start to practice tomorrow.
# If not, describe the part you got stuck on that requires more practice.

# Yes, I was able to solve from memory
# Tomorrow I will begin practicing hashes
